A foreign currency converter for travelers

The Flutter app was created originally for [State Management With Provider](https://www.kodeco.com/6373413-state-management-with-provider) at Kodeco, which at the time was raywenderlich.com (so the open-source license is still the one they used). See the tutorial branch for the original code. Later, I got permission to use the app for the article [Flutter programming on your phone](https://medium.com/flutter-community/programming-on-your-phone-a2547f0e293). And now I'm continuing development because it's a useful app and I'll see if I can make a few dollars selling it.
